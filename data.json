      "abstract": "Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal reasoning. This paper introduces Unified Audio Language Model (UALM), which aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate, using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning. Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed by subjective evaluations.",

To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.",

      "abstract": "Fugatto is a versatile audio synthesis and transformation model capable of following free-form text instructions with optional audio inputs. While large language models (LLMs) trained with text on a simple next-token prediction objective can learn to infer instructions directly from the data, models trained solely on audio data lack this capacity. This is because audio data does not inherently contain the instructions that were used to generate it. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a specialized dataset generation approach optimized for producing a wide range of audio generation and transformation tasks, ensuring the data reveals meaningful relationships between audio and language. Another challenge lies in achieving compositional abilities -- such as combining, interpolating between, or negating instructions -- using data alone. To address it, we propose ComposableART, an inference-time technique that extends classifier-free guidance to compositional guidance. It enables the seamless and flexible composition of instructions, leading to highly customizable audio outputs outside the training distribution. Our evaluations across a diverse set of tasks demonstrate that Fugatto performs competitively with specialized models, while ComposableART enhances its sonic palette and control over synthesis. Most notably, we highlight our framework's ability to execute emergent sounds and tasks -- sonic phenomena that transcend conventional audio generation -- unlocking new creative possibilities.",

However, these models continue to struggle with fine-grained, cross-modal temporal understanding, particularly when correlating events across audio and video streams. We address these challenges with two key contributions: a carefully curated benchmark and model, called OCTAV and OMCAT respectively. OCTAV (Omni Context and Temporal Audio Video) is a benchmark capturing event transitions across audio and video. Second, OMCAT (Omni Context Aware Transformer) is a powerful model that leverages RoTE (Rotary Time Embeddings), an innovative extension of RoPE, to enhance temporal grounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks.Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks and the OCTAV benchmark, showcasing significant gains in temporal reasoning and cross-modal alignment, as validated through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies. Both the OCTAV benchmark and the code will be made publicly available.",

AF2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3B parameter small language model, surpassing large open-source and proprietary models across 20+ benchmarks. Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs - 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, a large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Fine-tuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities. We conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the efficacy of our approach. All code and data will be open-sourced.",

Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech.

Nevertheless, different applications have been relying on different foundation models, since predominant pre-training techniques are either designed for discriminative tasks or generative tasks. In this work, we make the first attempt at building a unified pre-training framework for both types of tasks in speech. We show that with the appropriate design choices for pre-training, one can jointly learn a representation encoder and generative audio decoder that can be applied to both types of tasks. We propose UniWav, an encoder-decoder framework designed to unify pre-training representation learning and generative tasks. On speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech tokenization, UniWav achieves comparable performance to different existing foundation models, each trained on a specific task. Our findings suggest that a single general-purpose foundation model for speech can be built to replace different foundation models, reducing the overhead and cost of pre-training.",

Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data.

Additionally, integrating data and supporting diverse languages and styles in SVS remain challenging. To tackle these issues, this paper presents ExpressiveSinger, an SVS framework that leverages a cascade of diffusion models to generate realistic singing across multiple languages, styles, and techniques from scores and lyrics. Our approach begins with consolidating, cleaning, annotating, and processing public singing datasets, developing a multilingual phoneme set, and incorporating different musical styles and techniques. We then design methods for generating expressive performance control signals including phoneme timing, F0 curves, and amplitude envelopes, which enhance musicality and model consistency, introduce more controllability, and reduce data requirements. Finally, we generate mel-spectrograms and audio from performance control signals with style guidance and singer timbre embedding. Our models also enable trained singers to sing in new languages and styles. Several listening tests reveal both musicality and controllability of our generated singing compared with existing works and human singing. We release the data for future research.",

Our work proposes P-Flow, a fast and data-efficient zero-shot TTS model that uses speech prompts for speaker adaptation. P-Flow comprises a speech-prompted text encoder for speaker adaptation and a flow matching generative decoder for high-quality and fast speech synthesis. Our speech-prompted text encoder uses speech prompts and text input to generate speaker-conditional text representation. The flow matching generative decoder uses the speaker-conditional output to synthesize high-quality personalized speech significantly faster than in real-time. Unlike the neural codec language models, we specifically train P-Flow on LibriTTS dataset using a continuous mel-representation. Through our training method using continuous speech prompts, P-Flow matches the speaker similarity performance of the large-scale zero-shot TTS models with two orders of magnitude less training data and has more than 20× faster sampling speed. Our results show that P-Flow has better pronunciation and is preferred in human likeness and speaker similarity to its recent state-of-the-art counterparts, thus defining P-Flow as an attractive and desirable alternative.",

To overcome this, we present a multilingual, multiaccented, multispeaker speech synthesis model based on RADTTS with explicit control over accent, language, speaker and fine-grained F0 and energy features. Our proposed model does not rely on bilingual training data. We demonstrate an ability to control synthesized accent for any speaker in an open-source dataset comprising of 7 accents.

Previous efforts on voice conversion focus on explicitly disentangling speech representations to separately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead to information loss by discarding finer nuances of the original signal. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance, which serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. SelfVC is trained without any text and is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, cross-lingual voice conversion, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and pace modifications. SelfVC achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot voice conversion on metrics evaluating naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility of synthesized audio.",

Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end-to-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper we leverage the alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS and demonstrate its applicability to wide variety of neural TTS models. The alignment learning framework combines the forward-sum algorithm, Viterbi algorithm, and an efficient static prior. In our experiments, the framework improves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron 2) and non-autoregressive (FastPitch, FastSpeech 2, RAD-TTS). Specifically, it improves alignment convergence speed, simplifies the training pipeline by eliminating need for external aligners, enhances robustness to errors on long utterances and improves the perceived speech synthesis quality, as judged by human evaluators.",

We experiment on lines of text from popular handwriting datasets and compare different activation functions for the attention mechanism used for aligning image pixels and target characters. We find that softmax attention focuses heavily on individual characters, while sigmoid attention focuses on multiple characters at each step of the decoding. When the sequence alignment is one-to-one, softmax attention is able to learn a more precise alignment at each step of the decoding, whereas the alignment generated by sigmoid attention is much less precise. When a linear function is used to obtain attention weights, the model predicts a character by looking at the entire sequence of characters and performs poorly because it lacks a precise alignment between the source and target. Future research may explore HTR in natural scene images, since the model is capable of transcribing handwritten text without the need for producing segmentations or bounding boxes of text in images.",

We fine-tune the synthetic data by using QuartzNet, an automatic speech recognition model, to find and remove samples with skipped, repeated and mispronounced words. With this fine-tuned synthetic data and 10% of human data we are able to achieve keyword spotting scores (accuracy and F1) that are comparable to using the full human dataset. We provide results on binary and multiclass Wake-up-Word datasets, including the Speech Commands Dataset.",

In addition, for cases where an initial contour is not available and to alleviate the need for careful choice or design of contour embedding functions, we propose a NODE-based method that evolves an image embedding into a dense per-pixel semantic label space. We evaluate our methods on kidney segmentation (KiTS19) and on salient object detection (PASCAL-S, ECSSD and HKU-IS). In addition to improving initial contours provided by deep learning models while using a fraction of their number of parameters, our approach achieves F scores that are higher than several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.",

We experiment on two machine learning benchmark datasets with missing categorical data, comparing classifiers trained on non-imputed (i.e., one-hot encoded) or imputed data with different degrees of missing data perturbation. The results show imputation methods can increase predictive accuracy in the presence of missing-data perturbation. Additionally, we find that for imputed models, missing data perturbation can improve prediction accuracy by regularizing the classifier.",

The feature vectors are created by segmenting song(s) and extracting time and and frequency domain features from them, such as chromagrams, chord degree and interval classification. The pattern graphs built on these feature vectors provide the likelihood of a pattern between nodes, as well as start and ending nodes. The pattern graphs learned from a song(s) describe formal specifications that can be used for human interpretable quantitatively and qualitatively song comparison or to perform supervisory control in machine improvisation.
