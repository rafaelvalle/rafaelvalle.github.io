## Executive Summary

Research prophet who transforms emerging capabilities into core organizational pillars. Track record of "Zero to One" technical initiatives that became strategic pillars at **Meta** and **NVIDIA**.

**At Meta Superintelligence Labs:** Architected the *first* audio foundations for frontier multimodal models (Avocado and Mango); served as expert guiding audio understanding, generation and editing strategy across workstreams.

**At NVIDIA:** Drove the company's strategic pivot from ASR and TTS-centric pipelines to Audio General Intelligence, building the audio stack for flagship LLMs (Nemotron) and scaling a research organization from 3 to 13 scientists.

Delivered foundational models with **25M+ downloads**, tier-1 production adoption, and coverage on CNBC's *Mad Money*.

## Experience

### Meta | Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)
**Research Scientist | Technical Lead, Audio Foundations**
*July 2024 - Present*

#### Data & Infrastructure
- Architected the *first* audio foundations for Meta's flagship frontier LLM (Avocado), extending into audio-visual systems
- Designed high-precision multi-stage captioning pipelines at web scale, including verification and improvement
- Established data sourcing strategies ensuring modality-independent learning while preventing capability shortcuts
- Contributed to model codebase and data quality control, avoiding and resolving stability-critical training issues

#### Research & Product Direction
- Serving as expert for audio generation and editing within frontier multimodal generation efforts (Mango)
- Developing post-training strategies for audio understanding, generation and editing
- Defined and developed evaluation frameworks that became the organizational standard for measuring audio-visual intelligence, shaping long-horizon research priorities

#### Team & Organizational Leadership
- Served as primary audio expert across multiple teams within MSL, advising senior staff and distinguished scientists on audio ontology, skill taxonomies, and entity relationships
- Influenced organizational approach from single-word labels and ASR-only inputs toward audio-native inputs and free-form descriptions—adopted across META's family of apps and  evaluation workstreams
- Provided technical review across workstreams, identifying issues in synthetic data quality, audio loading artifacts, and codebase reliability


### NVIDIA | ADLR-AGI
**Research Manager / Research Scientist**
*October 2017 - July 2024 · Santa Clara, CA*

#### Data & Infrastructure
- Built and owned the end to end audio intelligence stack for **Nemotron** (NVIDIA's flagship LLM): data acquisition and large-scale labeling infrastructure, multimodal architectures for speech, music, and audio-visual reasoning, training recipes and evaluation systems

#### Research & Product Direction
- Initiated NVIDIA's strategic shift from ASR and TTS-centric pipelines to audio general intelligence, including joint understanding and generation (2023), directly informing the company-level roadmap, 
- Achieved frontier results within six months of strategic pivot: unified audio models and interactive multimodal systems internally described as NVIDIA's first "ChatGPT moment" for audio
- Established internal benchmarks that became reference evaluations across major external research labs
- For more details, see publications below

#### Team & Organizational Leadership
- Partnered with executive leadership to transform audio general intelligence from a specialized niche into a core pillar of NVIDIA's multimodal AI strategy within 18 months
- Scaled the ADLR-AGI research organization from 3 to 13 scientists, setting technical standards, research scope, and long-horizon direction

#### External Impact & Industry Partnerships
- Forged research collaboration with **Universal Music Group**, integrating frontier AI with creative industry workflows
- Pioneered foundational generative models including **WaveGlow, Flowtron, One-Aligner To Rule Them All, BigVGAN, Audio Flamingo Series, OmniVinci, Fugatto**
- **External Impact:** BigVGAN achieved 25M+ downloads; WaveGlow integrated into production stacks of tier-1 technology companies; Fugatto featured on CNBC's *Mad Money*
