## Work Experience

### Meta — Superintelligence Labs (MSL)
**Research Scientist** · July 2024 — Present

#### Strategic Data & Model Infrastructure
* **Architected the complete audio/audio-visual data foundation for Avocado ** (Frontier LLM), transforming nascent capability into a company-wide standard.
* **Pioneered captioning and data sourcing strategies** now used across understanding and generation models to ensure modality independence and prevent capability trivialization.
* Built multi-stage pipelines orchestrating models to maximize information extraction and data quality at frontier scale.
* Contributed to model codebase, identifying and resolving critical issues affecting training stability for next-generation systems.

#### Specialized Consulting & Strategic Direction (Mango)
* **Serving as the primary technical subject matter expert** for audio generation and editing within Mango (Frontier Multimodal Generation).
* **Guiding all stages of training**—from initial data strategy and architectural ideation to fine-tuning—consulting with non-specialist teams to bridge the gap between audio research and scalable multimodal engineering.
* **Defined evaluation frameworks for Projects Avocado and Mango**, determining what audio-visual intelligence means organizationally and shaping long-horizon research priorities.
* Developed assessment systems and demonstrations that shifted internal consensus on technical approaches for controllable audio synthesis.

#### Quality Systems & Engineering
* Engineered scalable quality control mechanisms for multimodal data across all training phases.
* Designed strategies identifying data issues at scale with significant precision improvements for frontier-class models.
* Daily collaboration with researchers from ex-OpenAI, ex-Google DeepMind, and ex-xAI on the integration of audio-visual reasoning into unified world models.

### NVIDIA — ADLR-AGI  
**Research Manager / Research Scientist** · October 2017 – July 2024 · Santa Clara, CA

#### Strategic Direction & Organizational Impact
- **Partnered with leadership** to transform audio general intelligence from non-strategic to a core company pillar within 18 months, establishing audio general intelligence as foundational to NVIDIA's multimodal future.
- **Initiated NVIDIA's strategic shift** from TTS-centric pipelines to audio general intelligence (2023), an initiative that directly informed the company-level roadmap.
- **Scaled the research organization** from 3 to 13 research scientists, personally setting the technical bar and long-horizon direction for the group.

#### Technical Achievements & Flagship Integration
- **Built and owned the audio intelligence stack used in Nemotron** (NVIDIA's flagship LLM), including data acquisition, evals, large-scale labeling pipelines, architectures, and training recipes.
- Achieved frontier results within six months of strategic pivot: unified models for speech/music, large-scale labeling infra, and interactive systems described as the first "ChatGPT moment" for audio.
* **Established industry benchmarks** that have since been adopted as reference evaluations by major external labs and research institutions.

#### External Adoption & Industry Leadership
* **Forged high-impact research collaborations** with industry leaders such as **Universal Music Group** to integrate frontier AI with creative stakeholders.
* **Pioneered foundational synthesis models** including WaveGlow, Flowtron, and Fugatto, establishing NVIDIA’s early dominance in neural audio generation.
* **Global Impact:** BigVGAN achieved **25M+ downloads**; WaveGlow integrated into the production stacks of tier-1 technology firms; Fugatto featured on CNBC's *Mad Money*.
