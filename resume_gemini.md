## Work Experience

### Meta — Superintelligence Labs (MSL)
**Research Scientist | Technical Lead, Audio & Audio-Visual Foundations** · July 2024 — Present

#### Foundation Strategy & Data Architecture (Project Avocado)
* **Architected the complete audio and audio-visual data foundation** for Meta’s flagship frontier LLM, establishing audio-centric representations as a new company-wide standard.
* **Primary Audio Lead for cross-modal capabilities:** Directed the audio strategy for complex reasoning tasks including activity recognition, entity detection, humor, and summarization, providing technical guidance to Distinguished Engineers on feature integration.
* **Pioneered captioning and data sourcing strategies** now used across understanding and generation models to ensure modality independence and high-fidelity audio signal preservation.
* **Engineered multi-stage model-in-the-loop pipelines** to maximize information density and data quality from audio-visual streams at frontier scale.
* **Optimized training stability** for next-generation systems by identifying and resolving critical architectural bottlenecks within the unified model codebase.

#### Strategic Advisory & Generative Direction (Project Mango)
* **Directing the technical roadmap** for audio generation and editing as the primary subject matter expert within Meta’s frontier multimodal generation efforts.
* **Orchestrating all stages of training**—from initial data strategy to fine-tuning—consulting with cross-functional teams to bridge the gap between audio research and scalable multimodal engineering.
* **Defined evaluation frameworks for Projects Avocado and Mango**, establishing the internal benchmarks for what constitutes "audio-visual intelligence".
* **Shifted internal technical consensus** on controllable synthesis through the development of high-fidelity assessment systems and specialized demonstrations.

### NVIDIA — ADLR-AGI  
**Research Manager / Research Scientist** · October 2017 – July 2024 · Santa Clara, CA

#### Strategic Direction & Organizational Impact
- **Partnered with leadership** to transform audio general intelligence from non-strategic to a core company pillar within 18 months, establishing audio general intelligence as foundational to NVIDIA's multimodal future.
- **Initiated NVIDIA's strategic shift** from TTS-centric pipelines to audio general intelligence (2023), an initiative that directly informed the company-level roadmap.
- **Scaled the research organization** from 3 to 13 research scientists, personally setting the technical bar and long-horizon direction for the group.

#### Technical Achievements & Flagship Integration
- **Built and owned the audio intelligence stack used in Nemotron** (NVIDIA's flagship LLM), including data acquisition, evals, large-scale labeling pipelines, architectures, and training recipes.
- Achieved frontier results within six months of strategic pivot: unified models for speech/music, large-scale labeling infra, and interactive systems described as the first "ChatGPT moment" for audio.
* **Established industry benchmarks** that have since been adopted as reference evaluations by major external labs and research institutions.

#### External Adoption & Industry Leadership
* **Forged high-impact research collaborations** with industry leaders such as **Universal Music Group** to integrate frontier AI with creative stakeholders.
* **Pioneered foundational synthesis models** including WaveGlow, Flowtron, and Fugatto, establishing NVIDIA’s early dominance in neural audio generation.
* **Global Impact:** BigVGAN achieved **25M+ downloads**; WaveGlow integrated into the production stacks of tier-1 technology firms; Fugatto featured on CNBC's *Mad Money*.
