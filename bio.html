Composer, conductor and computer scientist, Rafael Valle was born in the state of Rio de Janeiro in 1985, where he began his musical career as a rock guitar player and audio engineer. His works are written for different media and are equally influenced by psychoacoustics, human-computer interaction, machine learning and the visual/psychological aspects of rock concerts and meditation.<p>

Valle started his Master's study in the USA at the East Carolina University where he studied composition with Edward Jacobs, orchestral conducting with Jorge Richter and was assistant conductor of the ECU Symphony Orchestra. He earned a Master's Degree in Computer Music/Composition from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart where he studied with Marco Stroppa and Piet Meyer, focusing on psychoacoustic compositional strategies and designing augmented performers.<p>

An advocate of contemporary music, Valle co-founded Criação Dois Hum in 2006 — an international contemporary music series to showcase the music of young composers. Valle has also given lectures in Brazil, Germany and the USA, as well as radio interviews. As a conductor and performer, Valle is responsible for the premiere of works by living composers, having worked with performers such as the International Contemporary Ensemble, Ensemble Le Balcon, Abstrai ensemble, Ensemble Jocy
de Oliveira, 4'33" Ensemble, and the East Carolina Symphonic Orchestra.<p>

He has collaborated with multimedia artist Jocy de Oliveira as electroacoustic and assistant musical director to the opera Berio sem censura. The premiere included the Orquestra Sinfônica Brasileira, actress Fernanda Montenegro and the laboratorio di fonologia — live-electronics specially designed by Valle, based on Berio's experimentations with the human voice.<p>

Rafael Valle is currently pursuing an interdisciplinary PhD in Machine Listening and Improvisation at UC Berkeley, where he works with Edmund Campion and Ken Ueno in Music, Sanjit Seshia and Nelson Morgan in EECS and Tom Griffiths in Psychology. Previously, Rafael was advised by David Wessel and continues to benefit from interactions with Adrian Freed at CNMAT.
